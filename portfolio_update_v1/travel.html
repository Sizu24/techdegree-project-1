      <h2 class="box-title">1. Dubai</h2>
      <img src="images/dubai.jpeg" alt="Picture of building in dubai near ocean" class="travel-pic">
      <p>Dubai looks like one the coolest, most over-the-top places in the world.
         From the Burj Khalifa, the man-made islands, indoor ski resort,
        and riding ATVs in the desert. This is definitely the place I'd like to visit the most.

    <article class="info-box travel">
      <h2 class="box-title">2. Hawaii</h2>
      <img src="images/hawaii.jpeg" alt="Picture of hawaii" class="travel-pic">
      <p>I came from a tropical place, so ocean and beaches are my favorite places to go to. Besides
        relaxing by the ocean and warm weather, I would also love to see what a volcano looks like in person.

    <article class="info-box travel">
      <h2 class="box-title">3. Venice, Italy</h2>
      <img src="images/venice.jpeg" alt="Disney castle" class="travel-pic">
      <p>If I were to travel to a European country, it would probably be Italy. Riding gondolas, eating
        <strong>real</strong> italian food, and seeing the Colosseum would be awesome.

    <article class="info-box travel">
      <h2 class="box-title">4. Disney World, Orlando</h2>
      <img src="images/disney.jpg" alt="Disney castle" class="travel-pic">
      <p>No matter how old you are, Disney is always a fun place to be. Don't they call it
        the happiest place in the world? A week at Disney World would be a minimum. I heard this place
        is as big as San Francisco!

    <article class="info-box travel">
      <h2 class="box-title">5. New York</h2>
      <img src="images/newyork.jpeg" alt="Picture of Time Square" class="travel-pic">
      <p>Last place on my list is New York. I actually lived here when I first came to America with my family
        from Bangladesh. I was only 3 or 4 at the time, so visiting this place as an adult would be
        a whole diff experience.
